# How to guides

By [Nathalie Steinmetz](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaliesteinmetz).

## Description
**How to guides** is a CodeFellows App-a-day - a micro-app that showcases nested models. You have how to guides with corresponding steps in the app.

The app uses Simple_form instead of the standard forms. Also the app showcases an initial integration of internationalization: new locale dependent namespaces have been added, and all free text and titles are translated. Remaining todo is the translation of active record data and of links/buttons.
